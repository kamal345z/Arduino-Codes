# Smart Street Light system using Arduino and PIR sensors  
#Introduction :  
Smart street lighting systems aim to reduce energy consumption by intelligently 
turning lights ON only when needed. This project utilizes PIR (Passive Infrared) 
sensors, a light sensor (LDR), and an Arduino Uno to automate street lights 
turning them ON when it's dark and motion is detected, and OFF otherwise. 
# Advantages :  
• Energy Efficient: Turns ON only when dark and motion is detected.  
• Low Maintenance: Reduces wear on lighting systems.  
• Power Saving: Cuts down electricity usage drastically.  
• Eco-Friendly: Decreases light pollution and carbon footprint.  
• Automation: Requires no manual intervention.  

# Uniqueness :  
• Combines ambient light sensing (via LDR) and motion detection (via 
multiple PIRs).  
• Uses MOSFETs for high-efficiency switching, ensuring minimal power loss.  
• Could be scaled for smart city infrastructure.  
• Simulated in Tinkercad, allowing low-cost development and testing.  
    
# Conclusion :  
This Smart Street Light system is a cost-effective and intelligent solution for 
urban lighting. It smartly activates street lights only under necessary conditions  
(low light + motion), significantly conserving energy and promoting 
sustainability. By integrating simple yet effective sensors with Arduino logic, this 
project stands as a practical step toward smarter cities.
